A Minecraft 1.20 Plugin that uses PlaceholderAPI to broadcast top stat messages every 15 minutes with the help of PlayerStats. This plugin was primarily created for use on a private survival server. I don't plan to maintain this plugin actively; however, the code is available for anyone to use. Pull requests are welcomed.

LU7Stats is still in development and may contain bugs. The latest .jar can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/LuckVintage/LU7Stats/raw/main/target/lu7stats-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar).

**Prerequisites:**

[PlaceholderAPI version 2.11.5](https://repo.extendedclip.com/content/repositories/placeholderapi/me/clip/placeholderapi/2.11.5/placeholderapi-2.11.5.jar)

[PlayerStatsExpansion for PlaceholderAPI](https://github.com/Artemis-the-gr8/PlayerStatsExpansion)
